                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank">Elon Reeve Musk</a> (/ˈiːlɒn ˈmʌsk/;
                    born June 28, 1971) is a South African-born Canadian-American business magnate, investor, engineer and
                    inventor.
                    <br><br> He is the founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX; co-founder, CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors;
                    co-founder and chairman of SolarCity, co-chairman of OpenAI; co-founder of Zip2; and founder of X.com
                    which merged with PayPal of Confinity. As of June 2016, he has an estimated net worth of US$12.7 billion,
                    making him the 83rd wealthiest person in the world.
                    <br><br> Musk has stated that the goals of SolarCity, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX revolve around his vision
                    to change the world and humanity. His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy
                    production and consumption, and reducing the "risk of human extinction" by "making life multiplanetary"
                    by setting up a human colony on Mars.
                    <br><br> In addition to his primary business pursuits, he has also envisioned a high-speed transportation
                    system known as the Hyperloop, and has proposed a VTOL supersonic jet aircraft with electric fan propulsion,
                    known as the Musk electric jet.
